  Being able to [populate the pipe](01-getting-started-with-operation.html), or railway, of an operation and handle errors, we now dive into the Trailblazer gem and the abstractions it gives us: persistence handling, validations, policies, and all that.

  An importance architectural decision here is that most abstractions are implemented in completely separate gems. Those gems don't even know they're being used in a Trailblazer operation.

  Instead of shipping with tons of code to implement forms or policies, Trailblazer provides glue code that mediate between the operation (flow control and specific customization) and the additional abstractions (validations, persistence, etc.).

  This happens in *macros*, and we will learn a lot about those in the following session.

##  The Challenge

Coming back to the controller from chapter 01, I want you to quickly get an idea of what we're trying to achieve now.

    class BlogPostsController < RubyOnTrails::Controller
      before_filter :authorize_user!

      def create
        post = BlogPost.new
        post.assign_attributes(params[:blog_post])
        if post.save
          notify_current_user!
        else
          render
        end
      end
    end

This is a classic Rails controller setup. Check if the user is authorized, create a model, validate the incoming parameters, if successful, save and notify the current user about it.

We're going to rebuild this with a Trailblazer operation. We're also going to do that without any infrastructure framework, such as Rails or Hanami. This is content for the following guides.

{% callout %}
Code for this session is [here](https://github.com/trailblazer/guides/tree/operation-02).
{% endcallout %}

## WAT

Trailblazer is suitable both for greenfield projects as well as refactoring massive and messy legacy projects. The mechanics are always the same.

* Extract domain logic from controller, models and half-baked service objects and rearrange them embraced by an operation.
* Free the model: Validations go to forms (or contracts as we also call them).
* Callback code is triggered from the operation, not the model or controller.
* Authorization happens in policies orchestrated by the operation, not in random places in controller, model, or view.

You will see, it's actually quite simple to let the operation control the flow and other stakeholder objects implement the specifics.

## Gemfile

Have a look at the `Gemfile`.

    gem "trailblazer"
    gem "activerecord"
    gem "sqlite3"
    gem "rspec"
    gem "dry-validation"

The `trailblazer` gem brings the operation, the Reform gem for contracts, and some code for the macros we're going to discuss.

We already discussed `rspec`'s role. Mentioning the `activerecord` gem is important, since we need a persistence layer. Please be advised, though, that Trailblazer is database-agnostic: you can use ROM, `Hanami::Model`, Sequel, or whatever else you feel like.

For validations, we refrain from using `ActiveModel::Validation` in this example and use the excellent [dry-validation gem](http://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-validation/). Reform allows using `dry-v` out-of-the-box. In case you want to/have to use ActiveModel's validations, no problem, Reform does that, too.

## Model

Since we're going to create a new blog post record, it's a good idea to add a model class. I put that in `app/models/blog_post.rb`.

{{ "app/models/blog_post.rb:model:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

This is an empty model that skips all the features of ActiveRecord's that should've never been added, and leverages what ActiveRecord is amazing at: persistence.

{% callout %}
We also [have a `User` model](https://github.com/trailblazer/guides/blob/operation-02/app/models/user.rb), which is a simple Struct that allows us to set a `signed_in?` flag. In later chapters we will use a "real" user model and an authentication gem.
{% endcallout %}

## Procedural Approach

To implement the above controller action in an operation, you could simply throw the code into a single step, ignoring all the nice mechanics and error handling that comes with the pipe, but making it "understandable" to a new developer.

For illustration purposes, this `Create` operation goes to `app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb`.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:procedural:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

The operation now orchestrates model, validation and the notification "callback" that used to sit in the controller. Note that no HTTP-related code, like redirects or rendering results, is found here anymore. That's a step forward in our quest to separating concerns!

### Procedural Approach: Test

A quick test makes sure that our authorization kicks in and an anonymous user leads to a failing operation, and no model is persisted.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:procedural:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

We also test the [successful case here](https://github.com/trailblazer/guides/blob/operation-02/spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb#L21). It's obvious that our current implementation is not great, for example, we don't have access to the created model without manual work, which we don't favor, do we?

## Dependencies

Even though this operation is far from ideal, it demonstrates a very important concept in Trailblazer. Have you noticed how we pass in and access the current user?

There is no global state in Trailblazer, everything you need in the operation needs to go in via `call`.

The first argument is usually the framework's `params` hash [as discussed here](01-operation-basics.html#options). The second argument can be any hash specifying the dependencies needed in the operation, such as the current user.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:dependencies:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

By passing the current user with a string key, you will be able to access it via `options` in all steps. And, of course, you as the attentive reader still remember that you can use keyword arguments to grab that current user (or whatever else you need from the options) in a local variable.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:args:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

Here's what to remember about dependencies in a snapshot.

* Every dependency needs to go in via `call`, whether that is in a controller, a test, or a background job.
* Use [*required* kw args](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/ruby-2-keyword-arguments#required-keyword-arguments) wherever you can, as they will automatically raise an exception should the required keyword be absent.

## Exposing Values

Before breaking up this monolith into small, flexible steps, it's a good time to learn how we can communicate values to the caller via the result object. You remember, in our specs, in order to grab the model for specing, we had to use `BlogPost.last` - which yields potential for bugs.

Instead, we can simply write values to the `options` object. Those will be accessable to all following steps, as we'll see in a few seconds.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:procedural-set:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet : "hide" }}

Writing to `options` will also allow to read that very value in the result object, allowing us to change the specs slightly.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:set-spec:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

We can now test against `result["model"]` and retrieve the actual processed model instance.

## Manual Steps

While all this works fine, we actually don't need an operation for this procedural piece of code. We could put that in one of the "service objects" that spook through many Ruby applications out there.

Splitting up the procedural logic into steps will give us a better code structure and automatic error handling. Going further, using Trailblazer macros instead of manual steps, we will maximise stability and get helpful statuses in the result object.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:firststeps:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

Four steps now implement the exact same that we did in one procedural step. As you can see, error handling and `if`s disappeared because if a step returns a falsey value, the remaining steps will be skipped. I also advise you to take a minute and check out how we use different kw args per step - this is such a helpful feature, you should use it and understand it.

The specs we wrote still pass, so we're good to go to the next step.

## Policy

One big advantage of Trailblazer's `Policy` macro over our home-made `authorize!` step is: It will add its outcome to the result object, making it extremely simple to track what went wrong should things go wrong.

The other benefit of using this macro is: You don't have to use [the primitive *guard* implementation](/gems/operation/2.0/policy.html#guard), but use your existing [Pundit-style policies](/gems/operation/2.0/policy.html#pundit) to intercept unauthorized users.

For simplicity, let's go with the `Guard` macro for now.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:policy:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

Check line 2. Guards are a good way to quickly implement access control, but I advise you to invest some time in a separated policy implementation such as [pundit](/gems/operation/2.0/policy.html#pundit).

All `Policy` macros will leave a trace in the operation's result object. Here's the test snippet for anonymous users who will be declined.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:guard-result:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

In other words: every `Policy` macro creates its own result object within the operation result. With `Guard`, you can only ask for validity.

    result["result.policy.default"].success?

However, with `Pundit` policies, additional messages will be accessable via this "nested" result object. This is a great way to find out what happened in the operation should you get an unexpected invalid result.

## Model

Trailblazer also has a convenient way to handle model creation and finding. The `Model` macro literally does what our `model!` step did.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:model:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

This shortens our code even more, and reduces possible bugs. Of course, `Model` can also [find records](/gems/operation/2.0/api.html#model-findby) as we will discover in the next chapter.

Note that `Model` is *not* designed for complex query logic - should you need that, you might want to write your own step, use a query object or even combine both in a macro. Also, you can maintain multiple models, should you require that.

The specs still pass, as we haven't changed public behavior.

## Contract

As a next step, or better, as next steps, we need to bring the validation into the operation. Remember, in Trailblazer, you don't want validations in the model or the controller. These go into *contracts*.

Contracts are basically validations, and they can be simple callable objects you write yourself, or `Dry::Schema`s, or, as in this example, Reform objects. Luckily, the `Contract` macros make dealing with contracts (or forms, it's the same!) very simple.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:contract:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

As you can see, we added two steps after `Model`, and reduced the logic in `persist!` to saving the model. This code will break, but it's great to show you some mechanics with contracts, so bear with me.

## Build

The first new step is `Contract::Build`.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:contract-build:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

Even though Trailblazer allows to have ["inline contracts"](/gems/operation/2.0/contract.html#overview-reform), we don't want to clutter our operation with additional validation code. This is why I use the `:constant` option to tell `Contract::Build` what contract class to use.

Don't try to understand everything at once right now, just believe me that `Contract::Build` will create this mysterious contract class and pass it the operation's model.

Have a look at this contract in `app/concepts/blog_post/contract/create.rb`.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/contract/create.rb:contract:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

Without going into too much detail about contracts (they have their own guides), it's obvious that this contract defines its fields with `property` and then uses dry-validation's specific DSL to create a validation chain.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/contract/create.rb:validation:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

We simply define `title` as a required field, which must not be blank. Also, the `body` might filled, and if it is, it should be 9 characters minimum. Dry-validation needs a few minutes to sink in, but then it is so much more powerful and readable than the outdated `ActiveModel::Validations`.

The `Build` macro will always pass the operation's default model to the contract constructor and save the contract instance in `options`. What goes on here is this.

    # pseudo code
    Contract::Build()
      options["contract.default"] = BlogPost::Contract::Create.new(options["model"])

Again, no need to understand this right now, should you be unexperienced with Reform. We will go that at a later point.

{% callout %}
For those who know Reform: after `Contract::Build`, you always have the contract instance in `options["contract.default"]`.
{% endcallout %}

## Validation

Now, whatever building the contract implies, how do we run that *validation* against the incoming parameters?

Here's a passing spec snippet.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:validation-pass:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

In the test case, we pass in a manual hash to `call`, but in, say, a Rails app, this would be the params hash. This input is now validated via the `Contract::Validate` macro.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:contract-validate:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

Again, Reform's API will be utilized here by Trailblazer. We discussed earlier that the operation is only an orchestrator, knowing how to operate abstractions such as the contract, but having no further knowledge of how they work.

What `Contract::Validate` will do at run-time could be expressed as follows.

    # pseudo code
    Contract::Validate( key: :blog_post )
      reform_contract = options["contract.default"]
      result = reform_contract.validate(options["params"][:blog_post])

In a nutshell, Trailblazer uses the contract's `validate` method, passes in the fragment from the `params` hash you provided, and lets Reform sort out validations, generating error messages and providing an actual result for us. If that fails due to insufficient input, `Contract::Validate` will deviate to the left track and no further steps will be executed.

{% callout %}
It is incredibly important to understand the `:key` option here. `Validate` will extract the `blog_post:` fragment from the params hash, if you provide the `:key` option, and it won't continue if it can't find this key.

Omitting `:key`, `Validate` will try to validate the entire params hash, which is fine if you don't use wrappers. However, frameworks like Rails and gems such as `simple_form` always add this wrap, so be wary.
{% endcallout %}

Also, please note that Reform's validation takes away the need for `strong_parameters`. Since all desired input fields were declared using `property` in the contract, it can simply filter out other irrelevant keys.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/contract/create.rb:property:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

You don't need `strong_parameters` with Trailblazer.

## Errors

Let's play a bit with different input for our operation to learn how errors can be extracted from the result object.

In the first spec, we completely fail to provide any sensible input.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:validation-missing:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

Here, the `blog_post:` fragment in the params hash is completely missing, the validation is not even triggered. That is, because the extraction of the `blog_post:` fragment fails, which leads to a failed operation without any error message.

{% callout %}
In upcoming versions of TRB, this specific failure will be indicated better.
{% endcallout %}

The next spec sends a `body` with the wrong length - it must be more than 9 characters long. Why, we don't know, but the business asks for this validation.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:validation-size:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

By inspecting the contract's `errors` object, we can assert that our validations work. It's usually best to test the error messages to see if and what validations were triggered.

{% callout %}
We are working on `trailblazer-test` that will provide matchers for Minitest and Rspec to have less verbose tests.
{% endcallout %}

Trailblazer tries to abstract the Reform or dry-validation internals from you, so you can always access the contract's result field in the result object for errors and state. This also works pretty well when using form builders, which we will see in the next chapter.

## Persist

When running our to-be-successful test case, however, it still breaks.

{{ "spec/concepts/blog_post/operation/create_spec.rb:validation-fail:../trailblazer-guides/:operation-02" | tsnippet }}

The error message here will give us some hint.

    Failure/Error: expect(result["model"].title).to eq("Puns: Ode to Joy") # fails!

    expected: "Puns: Ode to Joy"
         got: nil

Apparently, the operation's `BlogPost` model got persisted, but it's empty. No attributes were assigned, even though they were valid.

This is because when validating the input, this all happens in the *contract*. Values to-be-validated are written and checked on the contract instance, not on the model. The model is not touched until we say so.

In other words: what we need is to push the validated data from contract to the model, and then save the model. This can be done with the `Contract::Persist` macro.

{{ "app/concepts/blog_post/operation/create.rb:persist:../trailblazer-guides:operation-02" | tsnippet  }}

Replacing our own step, `Persist` will use Reform's API to push the data to the model. In pseudo code, this is what takes place.

    # pseudo code
    Contract::Persist( )
      reform_contract = options["contract.default"]
      reform_contract.save

The [contract's `save` method](/gems/reform/api.html#save) does exactly that for us, plus it saves the model.

And... our tests pass!

BTW, another nice thing is: if the model's save returns false, this will also result in the pipe jumping to the left track, skipping our last step `notify!`

## Notify

Speaking of `notify!`, this is the last step we need to review, and then you can call yourself a Trailblazer expert. In the current state of our application, `Notification` is just an empty class doing nothing.

To conclude this chapter, I would like to keep it that way. A dedicated guide will talk about post-processing logic (*callbacks*), testing and mocking external services like mailers with dependency injections.

## Summary

You're now ready to write full-blown operations implementing the entire workflow for a function of an application. Even though you could do all the steps yourself, the TRB macros help you in doing so.

There might be open questions around contracts, but we will discuss them in a separate guide. If you can't wait for it, have a look at the Trailblazer book, page 51 et seq. explain Reform in great detail.

In the next chapter we will discover how to use operations in Rails, where HTML forms get rendered and send input to endpoints. Exciting stuff!
